Mornings with kids are chaos. Between getting dressed, making breakfast, remembering school bags, and getting out the door on time, the last thing you need is to be everyone's personal assistant answering questions about the day ahead.

DinkyDash helps by putting all the information your family needs on a single screen — generated fresh by AI every morning before anyone wakes up.

## The dashboard is ready before you are

DinkyDash runs a cron job at 6am every morning. By the time your family walks into the kitchen, today's dashboard is already on the screen:

- **What's happening today** — all calendar events at a glance, so everyone knows the plan
- **Whose turn for chores** — no arguments, the dashboard says so
- **Countdowns** — how many days until the things everyone keeps asking about
- **Something fun** — a fact, a challenge, or a personalized message to start the day right

## Five ways DinkyDash improves mornings

**1. Kids check the dashboard instead of asking you**

"What are we doing today?" "When is my playdate?" "How many days until my birthday?" All answered on the screen. Kids learn to look at the dashboard first, which means fewer interruptions while you're making coffee.

**2. Chore time is no longer a negotiation**

The dashboard rotates chores automatically. Today it's Lily's turn for dishes, tomorrow it's Sam's. It's right there on the screen in a colored badge. Fair, visible, non-negotiable.

**3. No one forgets what's happening after school**

Swimming practice at 4pm? Dentist at 3:30? It's all on the dashboard, pulled directly from your Google Calendar. Kids can read it themselves and know what to expect.

**4. The fun stuff gets everyone engaged**

Every morning there's a new fun fact or daily challenge written by AI. "Did you know that honey never spoils?" or "Challenge: try to make someone laugh before breakfast." It gives the family something to talk about and gets kids excited to check the dashboard.

**5. The mental load gets lighter**

Instead of keeping everyone's schedule and chore assignments in your head, it's all on the screen. The AI handles the presentation, the chore rotation, the countdown math. You just glance at it like everyone else.

## What a DinkyDash morning looks like

**6:00am** — DinkyDash wakes up before your family. It fetches today's calendar events, rotates the chores, calculates the countdowns, and asks Claude to write today's dashboard. The JSON is saved and ready to display.

**7:15am** — Your daughter walks into the kitchen and checks the screen. "Only 12 days until my birthday!" She sees it's her brother's turn to feed the cat. No arguments.

**7:30am** — Over breakfast, your son reads out the fun fact: "A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance." Everyone laughs. Today's daily challenge is to compliment a stranger.

**7:45am** — Before heading out, you glance at the calendar section. Right — your son has a dentist appointment at 4pm. Almost forgot.

## Getting started

DinkyDash is free, open source, and runs on a Raspberry Pi. Set it up once, and your family gets a new dashboard every morning without lifting a finger. Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/caspii/dinkydash) to get started.
