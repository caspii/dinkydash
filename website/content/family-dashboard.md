description: How DinkyDash uses AI to create a daily family dashboard with calendars, chores, countdowns, and personalized content.

If you've ever had a child ask "how many days until Christmas?" for the 47th time, DinkyDash was built for you.

DinkyDash is an AI-powered dashboard that sits on a small screen in your home — in the kitchen, the hallway, or wherever your family passes by. Every morning, it generates a brand new dashboard with everything your family needs to know for the day.

## What makes it different

Traditional family dashboards or shared calendars require someone to keep them updated. DinkyDash doesn't. You set it up once with your family's info, and Claude AI writes fresh content every single morning.

That means:

- **No manual updates.** The dashboard writes itself.
- **Always relevant.** It knows what day it is, who has events, and whose turn it is for chores.
- **Genuinely fun.** Kids actually want to look at it because there's always something new — a fun fact, a daily challenge, a personalized message.

## A typical DinkyDash morning

Imagine it's a Tuesday in November. Your family wakes up and walks past the dashboard in the kitchen. Today it shows:

- A cheerful headline: "Happy Tuesday! Only 3 more days until the weekend."
- Person cards for each family member with their photo
- Chore badges showing it's Lily's turn for dishes and Sam's turn to feed the dog
- A countdown: 28 days until Christmas, 5 days until Dad's birthday
- Today's calendar: school pickup at 3pm, swimming at 5pm, dinner at grandma's at 7pm
- A fun fact about space that Sam will probably talk about all day
- A daily challenge: "Try to make someone laugh before breakfast"

All of this was written by AI at 6am, specifically for your family, for this exact day.

## Five reasons to try DinkyDash

**1. It answers the recurring questions**

Kids love to ask the same things over and over. How many days until my birthday? Whose turn is it to take the trash out? When is our vacation? The dashboard answers all of these at a glance.

**2. It makes chores fair and visible**

DinkyDash automatically rotates chores daily. Everyone can see whose turn it is right there on the screen. No more "I did it yesterday" arguments.

**3. It keeps the whole family in sync**

By pulling events from Google Calendar, the dashboard shows what everyone has going on today. No more missed pickups or forgotten appointments.

**4. It brings a little joy**

The AI-generated fun facts and daily challenges give your family something to talk about at breakfast. It's a small thing, but it makes mornings a bit more interesting.

**5. It's completely private**

DinkyDash runs on your own Raspberry Pi. Your family data stays in your house. There's no cloud service, no account to create, no data being sent anywhere except to generate the daily dashboard.

## Getting started

DinkyDash is free and open source. You'll need a Raspberry Pi, a small display, and an Anthropic API key. Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/caspii/dinkydash) for setup instructions.
