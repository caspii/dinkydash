## Introduction

DinkyDash is a simple, customizable dashboard designed to display family-oriented information such as recurring tasks, countdowns to special events, and daily rotations. It's perfect for mounting on a Raspberry Pi with a display in a common area of your home, providing at-a-glance information for all family members.

DinkyDash is great for quickly answering those questions that kids like to ask again and again and again and again.

- "How many days till Christmas?"
- "Who's turn is it to take the trash out?"
- "When is my birthday party?"

The dashboard shows:
- Today's date
- Recurring tasks or roles (e.g., who's turn it is to do the dishes)
- Countdowns to important dates (birthdays, holidays, events)

DinkyDash is built with Flask and can be easily configured using a YAML file, making it simple to update and maintain without diving into the code.
